## 🤔 Why GreenKart?

### 🌍 Some Facts to Think About
- We use over **10 billion plastic bags** globally **every week**.  
- Plastics never decompose — they **break into microplastics**, polluting land, air, and water.  
- The average person consumes up to **5g of plastic every week** through food.  
- **8 million tonnes** of plastic enter our oceans yearly — by **2050**, there may be **more plastic than fish**.

### ♻️ Why Not Just Recycle?
- Only **9%** of all plastic waste is recycled.  
- Most are **downcycled**, meaning they become lower-quality products that can’t be recycled again.  
- Recycling helps, but it’s **not a long-term solution**.

That’s where **GreenKart** steps in — encouraging a lifestyle that **prevents plastic pollution at the source**.
